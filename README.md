# Ensemble Learning for Disease Symptom Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of ensemble machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on symptoms. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various classifiers and ensemble methods.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses a disease symptom dataset
- Encodes symptoms into multi-hot vectors
- Trains multiple models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes
- Implements Voting and Stacking ensemble classifiers
- Compares model performance visually

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the specified directory (update the path in the notebook if needed).
2. Open `models_comparisons.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and view results.

## Output
- Displays accuracy scores for each model and ensemble
- Visualizes model comparison with a bar chart
